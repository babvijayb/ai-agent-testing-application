Okay, I'm ready to help! Please provide the React component code you want me to write Jest and React Testing Library test cases for. I will do my best to create comprehensive tests that cover various scenarios and aspects of the component, including:

*   **Rendering:** Checking if the component renders correctly without errors.
*   **Content:** Verifying the presence and correctness of displayed text, elements, and attributes.
*   **Event Handling:** Testing user interactions like clicks, input changes, and form submissions.
*   **State Updates:** Ensuring that the component's state changes as expected based on user actions or props.
*   **Props:** Testing how the component behaves with different props.
*   **Accessibility:** (If applicable and possible within the provided component) Checking for basic accessibility aspects.

I will use the standard `describe`, `it`, `expect` structure of Jest and the `render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`, and other utilities from `@testing-library/react`.

I'm looking forward to receiving your component code! Let's get started.
